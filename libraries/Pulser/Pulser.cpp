// Constructor

// An instance of this class runs with millisecond-resolution timing in soft
// real time (meaning nothing disastrous happens if an update cycle is a little
// late).
// A Pulser starts out in its false (off) state and changes to its true (on)
// state after the off time has elapsed for the first time.
